# N-gram Language Models

## Project Overview
This project involves creating and analyzing n-gram language models using an Amharic corpus. The tasks include generating n-grams, calculating probabilities, and visualizing results through word clouds. Additionally, the project includes intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the models using TensorFlow.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the corpus data files.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with detailed analysis and code.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for generating n-grams, calculating probabilities, visualizing word clouds, and evaluating models.
- `results/`: Contains output results like generated sentences and word clouds.
- `images/`: Contains any images or visualizations.

## Installation
To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install nltk pandas matplotlib wordcloud tensorflow
